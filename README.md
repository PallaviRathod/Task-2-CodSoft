A word counter is a simple yet valuable tool that calculates the number of words in a given input. Word counters are particularly useful for writers, students, journalists, and professionals who need to meet specific word count requirements. A word counter provides not only the capability to determine the total word count within a given input but also offers the added functionality of identifying repeated words and displaying their frequencies.
